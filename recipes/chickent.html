    <p>Tasty, quick, chicken thighs, with juicy meat and a crispy skin; you will love
    this chicken that is ready for the table in less than 30 minutes!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Skin-on chicken thighs: 4 pieces</li>
        <li>Olive oil: 2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Smoked paprika: 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Garlic powder: 3/4 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt: 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Grounded black pepper: 1/2 teaspoon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 200 Â°C</li>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush the skin-side of
        each piece with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, 
        in a single layer on a plate.</li>
        <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and sprinkle 
            half the seasoning mixture evenly over the 4 chicken thighs.
            Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle remaining seasoning mixture on top.
            Place chicken thighs in the air fryer basket in a single layer, skin-side up.</li>
        <li>Fry in the preheated air fryer until chicken is brown and juices run clear, 
            about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
            least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
